# 🤖 Symptom AI Analyzer  

The **Symptom AI Analyzer** is a smart healthcare-focused web application built to provide users with **quick and personalized medical insights**. By entering details such as **age, weight, symptoms, and allergies**, the system uses AI-based logic to generate predictions about possible health conditions, suggest commonly prescribed medications, and recommend suitable dietary guidelines.  

The primary goal of this project is to **bridge the gap between patients and medical professionals** by offering a **preliminary analysis tool** that can guide users before they seek formal medical consultation.
